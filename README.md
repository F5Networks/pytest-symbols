pytest-symbols
==============


Overview
--------
- pytest-symbols is a pytest plugin that adds support for passing
  test environment symbols into pytest tests.
- The supported formats for symbols files are json and yaml.


Installation
------------
```shell
pip install https://github.com/F5Networks/pytest-symbols.git
```


Usage
-----
- use the "--symbols" option to pass symbols into a pytest run:

```shell
py.test --symbols tests/demo.json -- tests/demo.py
```

- use the "symbols" fixture to access symbols within a test:

```python
def test_with_symbols_fixture(self, symbols):
    print symbols
    assert symbols.client_ip == "192.168.1.1"
    assert symbols.server_ip == "192.168.2.1"
```

- use "pytest.symbols" to access symbols outside the "symbols" fixture:

```python
import pytest

from pytest import symbols as foo


def test_without_symbols_fixture(self):
    print pytest.symbols
    assert symbols.client_ip == "192.168.1.1"
    assert symbols.server_ip == "192.168.2.1"    
    print foo
    assert foo.client_ip == "192.168.1.1"
    assert foo.server_ip == "192.168.2.1"
```
